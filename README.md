# Decision-Modeling-with-Oracle-using-SQL
This is a repository to share my sql when I was working on a database management project at University of Connecticut. For this project, we built up a scenario in which we worked for a bank in India to improve small business loan approval rate for women in rural India. 

--In project phase II, we tested our database by inputting just 10 records using sql which incorporated aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.), multiple row conditions (ANY, ALL, etc.), and some conditional commands (CASE or DECODE). 

--For the final project, we had to deliver a professional presentation to the instructor for whom we prepared over 270 records to make good sense of the business. I was the only contributor to the coding section, so all the sql shared are solely done by me.
